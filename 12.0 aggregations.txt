Aggregation Pipelines

 - Aggregation operations allow you to group, sort, perform calculations, analyze data, and much more.
 - Aggregation pipelines can have one or more "stages". 
 - The order of these stages are important. 
 - Each stage acts upon the results of the previous stage.

$group
  - This aggregation stage groups documents by the unique _id expression provided.

$limit
  - This aggregation stage limits the number of documents passed to the next stage.

$project
  - This aggregation stage passes only the specified fields along to the next aggregation stage.

$sort
  - This aggregation stage groups sorts all documents in the specified sort order.

$match
  - This aggregation stage behaves like a find. It will filter documents that match the query provided.


$count
  - This aggregation stage counts the total amount of documents passed from the previous stage.
